Privacy Policy for Auto Record Moments

Last updated: July 16, 2025

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application "Auto Record Moments" (the "Application") for mobile devices.
What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

The Application is designed with your privacy as a priority.

Audio Recording: The Application continuously records audio to a temporary, looping buffer stored only in your device's local memory (RAM). This data is automatically overwritten as new audio is recorded. This data is never stored permanently or transmitted off your device unless you explicitly take action.

Saved Files: If you choose to save the audio buffer or trim an existing file, the resulting audio file is saved only to the directory you select on your device. The Application does not have access to these files after they are saved and does not share them.

Data Collection: The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, audio data, or usage statistics to us or any third party. All core functionality occurs entirely on your device.
